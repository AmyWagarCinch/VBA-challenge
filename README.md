# VBA-challenge Homework

In this homework assignment we are using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

I've created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

I've used conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

* For Bonus, I made the appropriate adjustments to my script that allow it to run on every worksheet.
